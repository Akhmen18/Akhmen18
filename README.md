### Hi there 👋
![Banner](https://github.com/Akhmen18/Akhmen18/blob/master/Images/Base.png)

<p> <b> I'm a Technology Enthusiast, trying to decide what to in life. I used to make Custom Roms for Moto G2 and the G5 Plus. Now just trying out the various fields in Computer Science. I love coding in a lot of different programming languages, but C++ holds a special place in my heart. 
I also make random vector wallpapers as they seem aesthetically pleasing ❤
Conversations are my forte (Basically I love talking and listening to new and interesting stuff😜)
