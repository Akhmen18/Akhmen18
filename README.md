# Hi there 👋

<p><b><em> I'm a Technology Enthusiast, trying to decide what to in life. I used to make Custom Roms for Moto G2 and the G5 Plus, now just trying out the various fields in Computer Science. I love coding in a lot of different programming languages, but C++ holds a special place in my heart. <br>
I also make random vector wallpapers as they seem aesthetically pleasing ❤ <br>
Conversations are my forte (Basically I love talking and listening to new and interesting stuff😜) <br> 
Feel free to text me on Instagram for any conversations ✌
